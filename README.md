A Game Dev Tycoon Mod test



1.You will have to have the Steam version of the game (until the beta is over).

Use the Steam beta feature.

Right-click on Game Dev Tycoon.
Click on Properties.
Go to the beta tab.
Select the beta version from the drop-down list. (If you don't see a beta version, try re-starting the steam client or log out from the client and log in again.)
Wait, until Steam updates the game. Once the update is complete, you can start the game (it should just work like usually).


2. Copy the contents of this folder to the "mods" directory in the Game Dev Tycoon Folder.

3. Load up the game.
